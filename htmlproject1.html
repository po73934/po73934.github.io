	<p> I was born in Fredericksburg Virginia in the great year of 1998. 
	As a young boy I enjoyed what felt like long walks on the beach with my family and reeking havoc around the house.
	My love for history began when I was young because of the many trips to Washington DC to see the museums.
	
	</p>
	
	<p> 
	When I was 8 my family moved down to Georgia because my dad had gotten an administration job in the Department of Defense education administration. 
	We moved to a small town called Peachtree City, Georgia. 
	I attended school from 3rd to 5th grade at Braelinn Elementary, all three years of middle school at Rising Starr, and two and a half years at Starrs Mill High school. 
	Half way through my Junior year of high school in mid-October my father came home with some news that til this day I can still remember the feeling of pure sadness, he said "We are moving to England."</p>
	<p>
	At this point in my life I had never been to Europe or out of the continental United States and moving at this point in one's life was rough. 
	Immediately we started packing the house because my father's report date was Jan 15. 
	It was a quick three-month span of packing, preparing, and researching for our new home. 
	
	</p>
	<p>
	Living in England was quite the adventure for a young 17-year-old. Moving to a new school was tough, but since it was a school filled with students whose parents were in the military being the new kid was almost normal.
	My new school was much more challenging than my previous school, but it ultimately would prepare me for the daily grind of college. On the weekends and on holidays off of school my family and I 
	would travel all over England and Europe. My travels took me to the Netherlands, Malta, Belgium, Ireland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, and Germany. Without a doubt it is hard to choose my 
	favorite because of the beauty of each, but if I must Brussels, Belgium has my heart. At first the experience was hard and at times I hated it but being able to reflect on all of the opportunities 
	I've had since moving to Europe I do not think there is any tangible or intangible thing in this would that I would trade for it.
